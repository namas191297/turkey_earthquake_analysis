# Earthquake Visual Data Analysis (Turkey, 1910-2017)

Over the years the earthquakes have been recorded by different organisations in Turkey. Bogazici University, as the most successful university in Turkey, has a earthquake research center and they collected up all the data during the years. The data was collected from the database with particular filters.

The data covers up all the recorded earthquakes in the latitudes between 25 - 50; longitudes 15 - 60. As the metering stations are placed in Turkey most of the recorded earthquakes are in latitudes between 35 - 45; longitudes 25 - 45. The database search time filter was set to dates 27/09/1910 to 27/09/2017. As there are too many earthquakes which have intensities smaller than 4.0, the filter of intensity was set to 3.5 to 9.0 (there was no earthquakes recorded larger than 9.0 intensity). 

All the data here is owned by "Boğaziçi Üniversitesi Rektörlüğü" and it can only be used for uncommercial issues with regards to "Boğaziçi Üniversitesi Kandilli Rasathanesi ve Deprem Araştırma Enstitüsü Bölgesel Deprem-Tsunami İzleme ve Değerlendirme Merkezi".
